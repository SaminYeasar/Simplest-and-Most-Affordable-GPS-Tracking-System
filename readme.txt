Sole idea of this project was to make cheapest GPS tracking system possible. Proposed GPS tracker was made for initially a Lab Project. We didn’t want to spend money on buying GPS module which would cost around 100 USD in Bangladesh and smart coding to execute it properly. So we decided to make the simplest and most affordable GPS tracker possible. We wanted to use our smart cell phone which already has an imbedded GPS and use MATLAB code to build a system that itself provided update GPS location once initialized. 

"Detail Description" contains our process and components needed to make the system.
"GPS_Tracker.m" contains the MATLAB code need to be used to operate the system.
"location.kml" contains one of our altitude and longitude example that mobile app will be providing.
